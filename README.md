# Audio-Enhancement-using-a-Score-Based-Generative-Model

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for audio enhancement using Score-Based Generative Models (SBGMs). The model restores high-quality audio by effectively removing background noise and distortions from degraded input signals. Built on Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and a U-Net architecture, the approach leverages diffusion processes for robust and efficient audio denoising.

**Features:**

1. Score-based generative modeling with SDEs

2. Lightweight U-Net architecture optimized for audio tasks

3. Mel-spectrogram-based preprocessing

4. Trained on synthetic and real-world noisy speech data

5. Evaluation metrics for audio quality restoration (PESQ, STOI, etc.)

**Use Cases:**

1. Speech enhancement for communication systems

2. Preprocessing step for speech recognition models

3. Noise reduction in archival audio restoration
